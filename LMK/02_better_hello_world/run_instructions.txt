To see the linux kernel headers, check this :

ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build


These have all the files to build the kernel module.

We made a hello.c and a Makefile,

hello.c holds the src for the hello linux kernel module
Makefile will build the kernel module

Kernel Headers generally start with linux/.

We have two important events 
1) module is loaded into the kernel
2) module is removed from the kernel

We do not have a printf, as there is no STDIO, instead we have kernel log, so we write into the kernel log.


This module requires a license to compile, like GPL from GNU.

Refer to my notes for understanding the code written!

we run make cmd after both files are populated.

Both compile and linking make a lot of different files.

we run tmux to open a parallel window, where you run the sudo dmseg -W cmd

In the original window, run the cmd sudo insmod hello.ko to print hello kernel

Repeat this with sudo rmmod hello.ko to print goodbye kernel

Some useful command is lsmod | grep 'filename'

To see the kernel logs, you need to run the sudo dmesg | tail, it shows the log from bootup
